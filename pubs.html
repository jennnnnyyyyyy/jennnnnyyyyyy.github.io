        "It might not be clear to you at first, but these boys are good friends. They have known each other since sixth grade, when they sat at the same lunch table, when the boy with the knife taught the short boy how to swear. On weekends they sit by the river together, throw pebbles at the water bugs. Last week they saw an eagle, watched it drown in the water under the weight of a fish it could not let go. Its wings beat faster and faster against the surface of the water until one wing dipped below, suddenly too weak to come back up, and then all that was left was a patch of choppy water. Neither boy spoke as the bird struggled, only continued to toss pebbles as they watched. "</a>
